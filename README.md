# Pearson's Bridge Motors

![Responsive](https://github.com/M-E-C-20/PB-Motors/blob/master/screenshots/responsive-screens.jpg?raw=true)

This is my website which will be used to advertise a small local garage.
It should feature the services offered and a price guide, an about page, a gallery and a contact page.
the primary goal is to intice customers to make contact with the garage via the contact page.

To do this I will need to make a comprehensive guide of services are available and use the price guide to give the customer confidence in what they are spending they're money on.
To bolster this confidence, I will include an about page and a gallery.
On the gallery page I will include some images of the garage and some helpful tips for self maintenance for the customer.

## UX

### User Stories

- As a new user, I want to find out what work can I get done to my vehicle?
- As a new user, I want to know if there is a breakdown service?
- As a new user, I want to know how much will the work cost me?
- As a new user, I want to know how can I contact you?
- As a new user, I want to know how do I book an appointment?
- As a user, I want to be able to sign up and sign in to avail of member discounts etc.
- As the owner, I want to advertise the services I offer to new customers.
- As the owner, I want to continue to maintain my existing customer base with loyalty rewards.
- As the owner, I want my site to be easily navigable to both new and existing users.

### Strategy

The main goal of the website is to make an easy way for the user to get a general idea of work that can be done to their car and to get an idea of the price structure in place.
I wish to design an intuitive, easily navigable website to create an enjoyable user experience, which wil benefit both users and the owner.
I wish to make it easy for the user to see what services are available to them and to provide details of the team and facilities to give confidence to the user while browsing on any device.

### Scope

I want to use a minimalist design to demonstrate to customers services offered,
and to ensure customer confidence using the about section. It is important to use a clear, simple interface to avoid delivering a poor user experience.
The option to contact the garage needs to be included also.

### Structure

In each section I want to keep a common navbar and a common footer.
In the header there will be a navbar with site links and a company logo.
In the footer section there will be copyright mark and social media icons which will act as buttons linking to their respective sites.

- [Mobile Wireframes](https://github.com/M-E-C-20/PB-Motors/blob/master/wireframes/MS1%20mobile.pdf)

### Surface

#### Colours

I decided to use a simple grey and white colour scheme which contrasts well together and is easily read.
This should create an accessible interface and suits a website for a small organisation with a limited needs, which is to get the user to try to make contact with the business.
The colours I used were #3e3b3b which was a grey colour and #e8e8e8 which was an offf-white colour. I chose these colours because I found them easy to look at and in every page the contrast has scored highly for accessibility.

![#e8e8e8](https://github.com/M-E-C-20/PB-Motors/blob/master/screenshots/white.jpg?raw=true)

### Fonts

I chose two fonts to use for this project: [Roboto Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Condensed), and [Goldman](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Goldman?query=goldm).
I chose these two because I think they are clean, mechanical fonts which suit the design of the website.
I used Goldman for large headers, and Roboto Condensed for the bulk of the content.

### Icons

I used the hamburger icon for my menu because it is widely recognised and used.
I used the car icon with Goldman font used for the logo.
In the what we do section on the home page, I used three icons, the wrench, medical laptop, and toolbox.
In the footer i used standard icons for copyright, Facebook, Youtube and Instagram.
All icons used in this project were sourced from Font Awesome.

## Features

### Existing Features

- Navbar - allows the user to navigate the site using the listed buttons. The company name/logo also acts as a home button.
- What we do - This section on the home page gives a general view of the services offered which includes a button which links to the contact page or, if trying to contact breakdown services, links to a phone number.
- Price Guide - A table which gives a general price range to inform the customer of costs before they choose to make contact.
- Footer - This will include social links which open in an new tab when selected.
- About - This section will give some information on the technicians and their credentials, which should help to inspire confidence in a user.
- Gallery - The gallery will include pictures which indicate the kind of work that is performed in the workshop, and help inspire customer confidence.
- Embeded Video - The embedded video at the bottom of the gallery is one that includes car maintenence tips for an ordinary person. This is designed to inspire trust between the user and business, by educating them.
- Contact Form - Allows users to make contact with the business, by having them fill out the form.
- Embedded Map - Allows users to locate the garage easily without having to leave the website to input the location manually themselves.

### Features to be Implemented

- In the future I would like to add a more comprehensive booking form, as a a=step up from the basic contact form i have implemented here.
- I would also like to include a members login so a customer could save their details and potentially avail of offers.

## Testing

1. ### Fixed Issues:

   - I decided to change the way the nav buttons appear on mobile as they were taking too much of the screen and hiding site content underneath, and could have been confusing for a user to use. Under advice from my mentor, there is now a navbar which is fixed to the top of the screen.
   - My mentor Rohit discovered that, suing the Galaxy Fold virtual device on Chrome DevTools, the screen had a horizontal scroll bar. This was due to the narrowness of the screen comined with more content than could be compressed causingthe table to overflow the window.
     This was fixed by removing some uneccessary words which were bloating the cell sizes in the table.
   - Rohit advised me to redirect my form submission from the contact page to go back to my home page when tested. Previously it was redirecting to an external source, Code Institute's form dump page, which he advised me against.
   - I was made aware that the email input in my form did not require an @ symbol and was missing a name attribute after I submitted my code for review on Slack. Thank you to the user Paul for alerting me to this.

2. ### CSS:

- First I manually examined my CSS structure and removed uneccessary items and arranged them in a more understandable and easy to read manner.
- I ran my CSS through [CSS Lint](http://csslint.net/) and found 4 errors.
- I ran my CSS by direct input through [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) which passed.

3. ### HTML:

   1. #### Home:

   - I ran index.html through [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) by direct input. It resulted in two errors, which were br elements within ul on the address and opening hours.
   - Removed br elements re-ran tests and received no errors.

   2. #### About:

   - I ran about.html through [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) by direct input. I found errors relating to invalid test elements.
   - Removed test elements, re-ran tests and received no errors.

   3. #### Gallery:

   - I ran gallery.html through [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) by direct input. I found errors relating to invalid test elements. I also found an error relating to an invalid main element.
   - Removed invalid elements re-ran tests and received no errors.

   4. #### Contact:

   - I ran contact.html through [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) by direct input. I found an error relating to an invalid row attribute within an input element.
   - Removed row attribute from input element, re-ran tests and received no errors.

4. ### [Chrome DevTools:](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools)

   - I used the Lighthouse feature within Chrome DevTools to simulate real world conditions and analyse performance, accessibility, and best practices on both mobileand desktop while doing so.
   - This resulted in adding the rel attribute to the social links in the footer on each page, which improved the websites best practices score all round.

5. ### [Color Contrast Accessibility Validator](https://color.a11y.com/?wc3)

   - I ran each page of the website through Color Contrast Accessibility Validator. Each page passed.

6. ### [Web Accessibility](https://www.webaccessibility.com/results/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fm-e-c-20.github.io%2FPB-Motors%2Fgallery.html)

   - I ran each page of the website through Web Accessibility. The gallery page showed one violation due to an iframe element missing a title attribute. Added title attribute, re-ran and found no violations. The contact page showed three violations, one for a missing title attribute within an iframe element and two for missing descriptions of a link.
     Added title attribute, added sr-only class to links, and re-ran test. Each page now has no violations.

7. ### Website Functionality

   - Each webpage on the website was tested using the same steps outlined below on desktop using Chrome, Opera, Firefox and Microsoft Edge.
   - Mobile testing was performed using the [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) virtual phone. I used three different virtual phones to ensure that the website functioned correctly through different screen sizes, as my mentor Rohit had found an erroron my homepage which was only visible using the Galaxy Fold virtual device.
   - With this in mind, the three virtual mobile devices I used were:

   1. iPad (768x1024)
   2. Moto G4 (360x640)
   3. Galaxy Fold (280x653)

### Acknowledgements

- I used the [Code Institute](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/readme-template) README template as a base for my own.
- I received inspiration for this project from my first job, which was in my family garage. I noticed that many small garages have no way of being contacted or even noticed unless through word of mouth.
- I took inspiration for the navbar styling from the UCD resume project, using the box style for the navigation buttons, symbols from font awseome, and a transition effect also as in the project.
- One of the main automotive websites I took note of was [Quick Fit](https://quickfit.ie/). In particular on the home page, I took from the opening hours and address at the top, and a row of services performed underneath.
  I borrowed the underline styling in the address and opening hours sub headers, and three separate columns with buttons that link to the contact page or to a phone number.
- The css for hovering the social media icons was copied and pasted directly from [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_hover.asp).
- I copied the css for the backgound image on the home page from the Whiskey Drop project.
- I copied the html snippet for the contact form from [MDBootstrap.com](https://mdbootstrap.com/snippets/jquery/temp/2746217?action=prism_export). I changed one of the icons, made the input fields required, and used my own text decorations.
- I also took note of [Pep Boys](https://www.pepboys.com/), [AA](https://www.theaa.ie/aa-membership.aspx?gclid=Cj0KCQiAhZT9BRDmARIsAN2E-J196kNgel1r2a3OZ1FP-m1-zD2rYuhpq-vEXjsWwIMJGivOowi3RFYaAm_ZEALw_wcB) and [JohnMcCarthy Recovery](https://www.johnmccarthyrecovery.com/services).
- I would like to thank the Slack community as a general source of information and for people willing to lend a hand.
- I would also like to thank my mentor Rohit Sharma for their valuable insight.
  Finally I would like to thank my partner and children for their understanding and support during a tough time.
