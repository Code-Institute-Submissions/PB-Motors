# Pearson's Bridge Motors

This is my website which will be used to advertise a small local garage.
It should feature the services offered and a price guide, an about page, a gallery and a contact page.
the primary goal is to intice customers to make contact with the garage via the contact page.

To do this I will need to make a comprehensive guide of services are available and use the price guide to give the customer confidence in what they are spending they're money on.
To bolster this confidence, I will include reviews and an about page.
On the gallery page I will include some images of the garage and some helpful tips for self maintenance for the customer.
 
## UX
 
*Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.*

*In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:*
### User Stories
- As a new user, I want to find out what work can I get done to my vehicle?
- As a new user, I want to know if there is a breakdown service?
- As a new user, I want to know how much will the work cost me?
- As a new user, I want to know how can I contact you?
- As a new user, I want to know how do I book an appointment?
- As a user, I want to be able to sign up and sign in to avail of member discounts etc.
- As the owner, I want to advertise the services I offer to new customers.
- As the owner, I want to continue to maintain my existing customer base with loyalty rewards.
- As the owner, I want my site to be easily navigable to both new and existing users.

### Strategy
The main goal of the website is to make an easy way for the user to get a general idea of work that can be done to their car and to get an idea of the price structure in place.
I wish to design an intuitive, easily navigable website to create an enjoyable user experience, which wil benefit both users and the owner.
I wish to make it easy for the user to see what services are available to them and to provide details of the team and facilities to give confidence to the user while browsing on any device.

### Scope
I want to use a minimalist design to demonstrate to customers services offered,
and to ensure customer confidence using the about section.
The option to contact the garage needs to be included also.

### Structure
In each section I want to keep a common navbar and a common footer.
In the header there will be a navbar with site links and a company logo.
In the footer section there will be copyright information and social media icons which will act as buttons linking to their respective sites.

### Skeleton 
- Home
- About 
- Gallery 
- Contact 
***
*I will need to make these links to wireframes*
***

### Surface 
I wish to use a darker colour scheme to give a sleek and more mechanical feel.

*This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.*

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

*In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.*

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.
- [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAhs79BRD0ARIsAC6XpaVYvwCWIORZNFLa4ZbfPQf8gAchZhdlP10mZeYDFooTFk1sW1Pua4caAgsmEALw_wcB)
    - I used Balsamiq Wireframes for desktop to generate wireframes for my project.
- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/tools/logo-maker-q1/?utm_source=google_sem&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=REV_UK_EN_CanvaPro_Logo_EM&utm_term=REV_UK_EN_CanvaPro_Logo%20Maker_EM&gclsrc=aw.ds&&gclid=Cj0KCQiAhs79BRD0ARIsAC6XpaV4sEhgBW0e4NXHPZWqHuup9scI62Xw9bDRG2VzYZ_2mEsON57tZ44aAp4sEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)
    - I used Canva to create a company logo for the website.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - I used Font Awesome to add to my navigation buttons.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

- Icopied the css for the backgound image on the home page from the Whiskey Drop project.

### Acknowledgements

- I received inspiration for this project from my first job, which was in my family garage. I noticed that many small garages have no way of being contacted or even noticed unless through word of mouth.
- I took inspiration for the navbar styling from the UCD resume project, using the box style for the navigation buttons, symbols from font awseome, and a transition effect also as in the project.
- One of the main automotive websites I took note of was [Quick Fit](https://quickfit.ie/). In particular the home page, with the opening hours and address at the top, and a row of services performed underneath.
